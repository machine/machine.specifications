using Machine.Specifications;

// This class demonstrates the creation of "empty"
// specs.. technically speaking, this is a normal
// context class in MSpec, with the exception that
// none of the It delegate members are assigned
// an anon method, so they're empty. That being said
// they will be parsed by the runner and still add
// to the test count, but show up as "unimplemented"
// in any reports.
//
// This functionality is entirely optional, as far as
// patterns go, but this is useful for documentating specs
// of some component of the software prior to it's creation,
// ie the UI prior to being designed. This allows
// the implementation team to put expectations down in
// code and have a place to come back to later, when
// the documented functionality is implemented (or
// intra-implementation, even).
