DESCRIPTION

ReportGenerator converts XML reports generated by PartCover or NCover
into a readable HTML report. 
In contrast to the XSLT-Transformation included in PartCover, the 
report is more detailed.
It does not only show the coverage quota, but also includes the source 
code and visualizes which line has been covered.

ReportGenerator analyzes one or more reports at the same time.
If you pass several reports to ReportGenerator, the reports will be
merged into one.
It is also possible to pass one XML file containing several reports to
ReportGenerator (e.g. a build log file).

COMPATIBILITY

PartCover 2.2
PartCover 2.3
